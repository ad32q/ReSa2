This is an early project and its corresponding code, which is for anonymization testing.  Given its initial stage, the code is far from its full - fledged state.  Therefore, it will be gradually supplemented and improved to achieve better performance and functionality. The code in this repository can run in some environments, but environment errors may occur in other environments.

This is the source code for the paper "ReSa2: A Two - Stage Retrieval - Sampling Algorithm for Negative Sampling in Dense Retrieval".  Tanonymization testing process and gain a deeper understanding of how it handles negative sampling to enhance the retrieval performance.
